- How to Run Program

1. Install packages in the requirements.txt file
2. Verify availability of datasets in Data/TCGA folder
3. Run code according to instructions in main.py
4. Results are saved in the /OutPut folder

- Folder Explanation

1. /Data folder contains datasets necessary for this program. In this folder there is a Reactome_FlslnGene data file containing gene-gene interactions. This is the interaction network dataset. The /TCGA folder which contains the cancer data for GBM, BRCA, OV and PRAD cancer. 

2. /Functions folder contains the different python function used in this research. contains function for contructing the bipartite graph, for returning results and for running the LBSA algorithm.

3. /Output folder contains the output results from running the code.
